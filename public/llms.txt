## About

AI is not a shortcut. It's my operating system.

I don't just use AI. I build with it. It helps me stay clear-headed at high-stakes altitude, not replace thinking.

That's the real synergy. Me plus the machine.

## Principles That Drive syNRGy

How I show up under pressure. These guide how I use AI and how I expect my team to use it.

1. Clarity over cleverness
2. Judgment first, tools second
3. First drafts are cheap. Decisions are not.
4. Speed without urgency
5. Ruthless simplicity

## How I Think and Operate

AI is how I think, build, and ship. It surfaces trade-offs, accelerates research, and turns ideas into working tools.

### 1. Building tools and automating research
- Create interactive dashboards for market and competitive analysis
- Prototype strategic tools for board and leadership discussions
- Automate intelligence gathering and turn data into decisions
> "From question to deployed tool in hours."

### 2. Turning complexity into clear narratives
- Simplify executive updates and leadership comms
- Clarify throughlines across multiple themes
- Reduce cognitive load without losing substance
> "I own the final framing and message."

### 3. Pressure-testing strategy and trade-offs
- Stress-test assumptions
- Explore second- and third-order effects
- Identify risks, edge cases, and blind spots
> "AI helps me see more angles. I decide what matters."

### 4. Accelerating first drafts
- Draft initial versions of memos, emails, and frameworks
- Explore multiple phrasings quickly
- Get momentum without over-investing early
> "Drafting is cheap. Decisions are not."

### 5. Clarifying language when stakes are high
- Tighten language in sensitive communications
- Remove ambiguity and unintended signals
- Ensure tone is calm, direct, and grounded
> "Words matter. AI helps me choose them more deliberately."

## How My Team Uses AI

AI is part of how we work. It is not mandated, but it is expected to be used thoughtfully to improve clarity, speed, and quality.

### Product
- Synthesizing discovery and customer insights
- Drafting PRDs and strategy outlines
- Exploring edge cases and alternative approaches

### Engineering & Data
- Design discussions and architectural trade-offs
- Debugging support and hypothesis generation
- Accelerating analytics from idea to insight

### Design
- Copy exploration and iteration
- Critique and alternative concept exploration
- Accessibility and usability checks

### Leadership
- Executive communications and narrative clarity
- Scenario planning and decision prep
- Framing trade-offs for alignment conversations

### What we do NOT use AI for
- Final decisions without human judgment
- Performance or people feedback without direct context
- Avoiding hard conversations or accountability
> "AI supports thinking. It does not replace responsibility."

## Active Workflows (2026)

My daily workflows, prioritized by impact.

### Research to Executive & Board Ready
Web research > Claude Code > Interactive HTML > Vercel
Turn raw intelligence into deployed analysis tools, e.g., competitive dashboards, market prioritization.

### Strategy to Stakeholder Deck
Markdown docs > Claude Code > Presentation-ready materials

### Idea to Working Prototype
Concept > Claude Code > GitHub > Deploy
Ship working prototypes in hours, not weeks.

### Meeting to Action
AI capture > Automated extraction > Knowledge base

### This Page
Auto-updated as I build
This living record updates itself. As I build new tools and workflows, they're automatically logged here.
