## About

AI is not a shortcut. It's my operating system.

How I use AI to lead with 10x leverage — build with it, research with it, operate at the right altitude, and make better decisions faster.

## How I Use AI

AI is how I think, build, and ship. It surfaces trade-offs, accelerates research, and turns ideas into working tools. I stay accountable for judgment and decisions.

### 1. Building tools and automating research
- Create interactive dashboards for market and competitive analysis
- Prototype strategic tools for board and leadership discussions
- Automate intelligence gathering and turn data into decisions
> "I don't just use AI. I build with it."

### 2. Turning complexity into clear narratives
- Simplify executive updates and leadership comms
- Clarify throughlines across multiple themes
- Reduce cognitive load without losing substance
> "I own the final framing and message."

### 3. Pressure-testing strategy and trade-offs
- Stress-test assumptions
- Explore second- and third-order effects
- Identify risks, edge cases, and blind spots
> "AI helps me see more angles. I decide what matters."

### 4. Accelerating first drafts
- Draft initial versions of memos, emails, and frameworks
- Explore multiple phrasings quickly
- Get momentum without over-investing early
> "Drafting is cheap. Decisions are not."

### 5. Clarifying language when stakes are high
- Tighten language in sensitive communications
- Remove ambiguity and unintended signals
- Ensure tone is calm, direct, and grounded
> "Words matter. AI helps me choose them more deliberately."

## How My Team Uses AI

AI is part of how we work. It is not mandated, but it is expected to be used thoughtfully to improve clarity, speed, and quality.

### Product
- Synthesizing discovery and customer insights
- Drafting PRDs and strategy outlines
- Exploring edge cases and alternative approaches

### Engineering & Data
- Design discussions and architectural trade-offs
- Debugging support and hypothesis generation
- Using agents to accelerate analytics from idea to insight

### Design
- Copy exploration and iteration
- Critique and alternative concept exploration
- Accessibility and usability checks

### Leadership
- Executive communications and narrative clarity
- Scenario planning and decision prep
- Framing trade-offs for alignment conversations

### What we do NOT use AI for
- Final decisions without human judgment
- Performance or people feedback without direct context
- Avoiding hard conversations or accountability
> "AI supports thinking. It does not replace responsibility."

## Operating Principles

These guide how I use AI and how I expect my team to use it.

1. Clarity over cleverness
2. AI amplifies judgment. It doesn't replace it.
3. First drafts are cheap, decisions are not
4. Speed without urgency. AI buys time for better decisions.
5. Ruthless simplicity. If it doesn't clarify, cut it.

## Active Workflows (2026)

These are my daily workflows — prioritized by impact. Each one replaces what used to take a team or a week.

### Research → Executive & Board Ready
Web research → Claude Code → Interactive HTML → Vercel
Turn raw intelligence into deployed analysis tools — e.g., competitive dashboards, market prioritization.

### Strategy → Stakeholder Deck
Markdown docs → Claude Code → Presentation-ready materials

### Idea → Working Prototype
Concept → Claude Code → GitHub → Deploy
Ship working prototypes in hours, not weeks.

### Meeting → Action
AI capture → Automated extraction → Knowledge base

### This Page
Auto-updated as I build
This living record updates itself. As I build new tools and workflows, they're automatically logged here.

## Active Tools (2026)

The stack that lets me build and ship without waiting on anyone. Total weekly savings: 16+ hours.

| Tool | Purpose | Setup | Saves/Week |
|------|---------|-------|------------|
| AI Coding Agent | Build, edit, and ship from natural language | 1 hr | 8 hrs |
| Meeting Intelligence | Auto-capture and extract action items | 15 min | 3 hrs |
| Rapid Prototyping | Turn prompts into deployed web apps | 30 min | 2 hrs |
| Instant Deploy | Ship to production from terminal | 10 min | 1 hr |
| Workflow Automation | Connect tools and eliminate manual steps | 1 hr | 2 hrs |
